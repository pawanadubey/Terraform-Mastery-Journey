# What is Terraform?
Terraform is a tool that helps people create and manage their computer systems and networks.
It does this by allowing you to write code that describes the systems you want to have.
You can then use this code to set up the systems on different cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud.
The advantage of using Terraform is that you can make changes to your systems easily and quickly, and also it helps to automate the process of creating, updating and deleting resources.
It's like a recipe for your computer systems, you write it once and use it multiple times.
It's a way to make managing your computer systems more efficient and less error-prone.

# Why use Terraform?
There are several reasons why you might want to use Terraform:
### 1. Consistency and Repeatability: 
Terraform allows you to define your infrastructure as code.
This means that you can version control your infrastructure and collaborate with others to make changes.
It also means that you can create and manage your infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable way.

### 2. Automation: 
With Terraform, you can automate the process of creating, updating and deleting resources.
This means that you can make changes to your infrastructure quickly and easily, without the need for manual steps.

### 3. Flexibility: 
Terraform supports multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments, so you can use it to manage resources in the cloud that you prefer.

### 4. Cost Optimization: 
With Terraform you can schedule your resources to be turned off when not in use, this means that you only pay for what you use, and you can also use it to monitor and scale resources according to the traffic.

### 5. High level of abstraction: 
Terraform allows you to manage resources in a higher level of abstraction, this means that you don't have to worry about the low-level details of the resources, Terraform takes care of it.

### 6. Community: 
Terraform has a big and active community that provides a lot of resources, modules and plugins to make the user's life easier.

### 7. Collaboration: 
Terraform allows multiple teams to work on the same infrastructure in a safe and secure way, also allows to limit the access to different teams by using workspaces.

# Why Terrform over other tools?
While Azure Resource Manager (ARM) and AWS CloudFormation are also tools that can be used to provision and manage infrastructure resources, Terraform has some key differences and advantages over these tools:
### 1.Multi-Cloud Support: 
Terraform supports multiple cloud providers and on-premises environments, while ARM and CloudFormation are specific to Azure and AWS respectively. This means that with Terraform, you can manage resources across multiple cloud providers from a single configuration.
### 2. Language: 
Terraform uses its own configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), which is easy to learn and understand, while ARM uses JSON and CloudFormation uses YAML.
### 3. Modularity: 
Terraform allows you to organize your configurations in modules, which makes it easy to reuse code and share it with others. ARM and CloudFormation, on the other hand, do not have built-in support for modules.
